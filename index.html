                            <p>I'm Chris...I'm a recent college graduate who loves tech and majored in computer technology. I recently moved to Portland,Oregon to learn more about software engineering and hopefully work towards doing cool things with AI. I'm a little quirky, pretty good at golf, love making music on my MPC, and hanging with friends.</p>

                               <li>I was lucky enough to work at Bel-Air as a golf caddy while I attended college at CSULA. It was a great time meeting people and working for famous people sometimes. My main duties were to carry my players golf bags, give advice to them, and to overall act cool around them so that they have a good time. Before I worked at Bel-Air I worked at another golf called Annadale in nearby Pasadena that I truly made some great friends. Being a golf caddy was hard work but it was a very awarding experience. </li>
